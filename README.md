- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Luke. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning everything that I can to better prepare me for heading into the world of work. Although, my stronger points are web development, and Python. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot. I'm still a beginner with computer science, and by extension, creating everything that goes along with coding. But I'm getting there. With every day, I learn more and more. Regarding specifics, I am currenly learning Python, Node.js, Javascript, Java, SQL and C#.
